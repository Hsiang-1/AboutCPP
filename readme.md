# This is a workspace for C/C++ Learning

### FYI

This repository documents the road of my C/C++ learning, and it's still being updated...

I'm just a beginner, you can [contact me](https://github.com/Hsiang-1/AboutCPP/issues) if there is any mistake or suggestion.

using namespace std;

int main( int argc, char **argv)
{
    cout << "Hello world!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
